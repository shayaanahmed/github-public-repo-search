# Github Repository Search 
The service is able to provide: 
* A list of the most popular repositories, sorted by number of stars. 
* An option to be able to view the top 10, 50, 100 repositories should be available. 
* Given a date, the most popular repositories created from this date onwards should be returned. 
* A Ô¨Ålter for the programming language would be a great addition to have.
